    field with the data type of a nested model. These fields are stored in previous fields. The model relies on the
    check of at least one of these previous fields being successful. This can be used to have kind of a recursive
    check of deeply nested models where you could have one model per step and still ensure that all previous steps
    are valid without having knowledge about their inner workings. The input data is assumed to be flat and will be
    adapted in the constructor.


    NOTE: If you want to use this model to create a fork (where other RecursiveDataModels will depend on either
    answer as in the diagram below) you will need more than one model. One for each answer that you are depending on.

    Let's say you have the following decision tree:
                    Question A
                YES //       \\ NO
                //               \\
            Question B      Question C


    You would then have the following Models: QuestionAYesModel, QuestionANoModel, QuestionBModel and QuestionCModel.

    These models would have the following dependencies:
    1) QuestionAYesModel -> QuestionBModel
    2) QuestionANoModel -> QuestionCModel
